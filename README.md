As part of my journey into game development, I created this interactive game where players challenge the computer by selecting between three choices: snake, water, or gun. The game determines the winner through predefined logic and rules, adding a fun twist to traditional gameplay! 🐍💧🔫

This project allowed me to refine my skills in:

🚀 C Programming: Crafting an engaging game from scratch while deepening my knowledge of C.

🤖 Game Logic: Implementing conditional structures and logical flow for real-time decision-making.

🎲 Player vs. Computer Interactions: Creating an AI-driven opponent for an engaging experience.

Engaging with such projects is invaluable for building foundational skills in game development and software engineering, and I’m excited to take on more ambitious challenges in the field!
